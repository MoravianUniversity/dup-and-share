Dup-And-Share
=============

Simple web app to duplicate and share Google Drive files with groups of people. Used in the
classroom to share files with students at Moravian University.

TODO
----

- [ ] How do shortcuts work in this? (how do I want them to work?)
- [ ] How to create new folders? (use upload view instead?)
- [ ] Copy-Paste Group File (reuse click-and-drag code mostly)
- [ ] Does not support stripping answers although it was supported in the orignal Python version.
